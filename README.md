# speedcontrol-dev-built-files
Files built from the dev branch of [NodeCG Speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol), for those who don't know how to build the files themselves.

## Installation
Make sure you uninstall old versions of [NodeCG Speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol) first.

To install this bundle, navigate to your root NodeCG folder using Command Prompt or similar (I like [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)). Then, type in the following command and press enter.

```nodecg install nicnacnic/speedcontrol-dev-built-files```

## Please Note
This verionm from January 21st, 2021, will get more out-of-date as time passes. Hopefully they update the release to include support for custom player data!
